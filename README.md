## Tools

- Front-end: Dart - Flutter framework
- State Management: Bloc
- Data Networking: Dio package
- Local Storage: SQLlite


## Challenges Faced

- API limitations: The dummyjson API had some limitations in terms of available features. Had to implement workarounds for certain functionalities.
- State Management Complexity: Managing state transitions efficiently with Bloc required a careful design to avoid unnecessary rebuilds and ensure a smooth user experience.
- Performance Optimization: Ensured smooth UI interactions by optimizing state management and avoiding redundant network calls.
